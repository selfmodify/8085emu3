This program simulates an 8085 microprocessor kit.
(Technically this is a 8085 instruction set simulator)

It has a very good online help with hypertext facility.
The package has features like :-

0. A two pass assembler :- 
   Your 8085 programs can be stored as normal ASCII text and submitted to 
   the program, this will be parsed by a two pass assembler. 

1. Viewing the 8085 code in mnemonic form 

2. Changing the instructions, data, registers and flags on the fly

3. Function key description
